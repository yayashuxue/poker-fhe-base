## Background 
First, centralized poker games have been notoriously famous for their problems. Hand manipulation, card eavesdropping, etc. With the rise of crypto, people have been trying to build decentralized solutions. 
## Existing Solution's Problem
'Mental Poker', a paper written by the founders of RSA, as many people trying to build poker on-chain trying to implement has been a very popular, fair, and decentralized solution for players. However, mental poker requires submitting a **ZKProof**, alongside each poker shuffle & encrypt on their device, which drastically slows down the experience.
## How to solve it
With the latest Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology (FHE), we can have smart contracts to do the work of FHE for the sake of the player without leaking the information, which means there is no need for users to submit ZKProof. This has huge potential to drastically improve the speed & UX. As a result, we build this project to test out this innovative route.
## Plan
Layer 3 - While there is a lot of optimization going on on L2, having a game layer (layer 3) is very important and can make ux even smoother. We want to implement or integrate layer 3 to make the poker game smoother.
AA - AA can also reduce the interaction one needs to have on-chain per poker game to 0.
